## What is ResumeAI?

ResumeAI is a full-stack AI career platform that combines **vector embeddings**, **semantic search**, **graph-based recommendations**, and a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline** to help job seekers tailor their resumes, generate cover letters, prepare for interviews, track job applications, and discover matching job opportunities — all powered by Google Gemini.

## Features

### Resume Upload & Management
Upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT files. The system extracts text, chunks it, generates embeddings, and stores metadata in MongoDB with vectors in Qdrant.

### Semantic Resume Search
Describe your ideal candidate or role in plain English. The app embeds the query and performs vector similarity search to return the most relevant resumes from your collection.

### AI Resume Tailoring (RAG + Knowledge Graph)
Paste a job description. The system:
1. Extracts skills from the JD and your resume
2. Queries Neo4j for related skills (skill co‑occurrence graph)
3. Embeds the JD and resume, retrieves relevant chunks
4. Injects both retrieved context and graph insights into a structured prompt
5. Returns a tailored resume with match score, key changes, suggestions, and a collapsible graph insights section showing related skills

### Cover Letter Generator
Generate a personalised cover letter grounded in your actual resume content and the job description. Save, copy, or export as PDF.

### Interview Insights
Get 10 technical and behavioural questions tailored to the specific role and your resume profile. Save question sets for later practice.

### Job Matcher
Add job descriptions manually or fetch real‑time listings via the **JSearch API** (powered by Google for Jobs). The system embeds them (rate-limited to 10/day) and matches against your resume using vector similarity scores.

### Knowledge Graph Skill Recommendations
A Neo4j graph stores skill relationships (e.g., `React → Redux`, `Node.js → Express`). When a job description mentions certain skills, the graph returns related skills that are not already present, providing data‑driven suggestions for career growth. Users can give 👍/👎 feedback, which dynamically adjusts the graph edge weights, creating a **self‑improving recommendation engine**.

### Application Tracker
Log job applications (company, role, status, date, notes). Link each application to a tailored resume or cover letter. Update status as you progress (Saved → Applied → Interview → Offer → Rejected). All applications are stored and displayed in a dedicated dashboard, helping you organise your job search pipeline.

### Dashboard
Central view of all saved tailored resumes, cover letters, interview question sets, and tracked job applications. See match scores, AI analysis, graph‑derived skill insights, and application statuses.

### PDF Export
Download any generated content (tailored resume, cover letter) as a PDF using `html2pdf.js`.

### Dark / Light Theme
Toggle between themes with preference persisted in localStorage.

### Secure Authentication
JWT + HTTP-only cookie auth with Redis-backed token blacklisting for instant logout/revocation.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React 18, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, React Router, Axios, html2pdf.js |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose), Redis, Qdrant, Bull MQ, Neo4j |
| **AI** | Google Gemini API (embeddings + content generation) |
| **Storage** | Cloudinary (files), MongoDB (metadata), Qdrant (vectors), Neo4j (knowledge graph) |
| **Auth** | JWT, bcrypt, HTTP-only cookies, Redis token blacklist |
| **Deployment** | Vercel (frontend), Render (backend) |

## Key Engineering Decisions

**Why Qdrant?**  
Qdrant offers efficient approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) search with metadata filtering — critical for per-user vector isolation without cross-contaminating search results across accounts.

**Why Neo4j?**  
Skill relationships are inherently graph‑shaped. Neo4j allows us to traverse connections (e.g., “people with React also know Redux”) and feed those insights into the RAG pipeline, turning raw data into actionable recommendations.

**Why Bull MQ?**  
Embedding generation and LLM calls are slow. Offloading them to a job queue decouples the API response from the heavy lifting, enabling retries, progress tracking, and graceful failure handling.

**Why RAG over naive prompting?**  
Injecting retrieved resume and JD chunks as context grounds the LLM output in the user's actual content, reducing hallucination and improving relevance. Chunk size is tuned to 300–500 tokens with 50-token overlap to preserve sentence boundaries.

**Rate limiting**  
Per-user rate limiting on embedding endpoints (10 JD embeddings/day) prevents API cost overrun while keeping the free tier viable.

**Auth security**  
Token blacklisting in Redis ensures that logout is immediate and stateless JWTs cannot be replayed after revocation.

**Self‑improving recommendations**  
User feedback (👍/👎) updates Neo4j edge weights, so the most helpful skill relationships naturally rise to the top over time.
